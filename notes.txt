We can use `rsvg-convert -f pdf -o <name>.pdf <name>.svg` to convert SVG images
to PDF.
Then, to include the image, use
`knitr::include_graphics("<name>.svg", auto_pdf = TRUE)`

We can use `usethis::use_tidy_description()` to tidy the 'DESCRIPTION' file,
and especially re-order imports in alphabetical order (easier to read).
However, the output must be checked, because sometimes the tool will break
some information! The SystemRequirements in particular is less readable (IMHO),
and it replaced the Author content by a dot "."!
Best to commit before, then tidy, and finally amend to avoid losing work.

We need to be in math mode to use \texttt? (Otherwise, pandoc will not produce
the correct text in HTML). However, LaTeX does not support using `_` in texttt
and math mode (because it means subscript). We can use `\_` to tell LaTeX
to print an (escaped) underscore, but HTML does not understand it and prints
literally `\_`.
Other alternative: using the `\mathtt` command.

TODO: Clean included packages in the LaTeX template.
  Some of them are included multiple times => need to find where and which
  options should we keep.

About `\phantomsection`:
We need it for both the List of Algorithms and the Appendix "false" part,
so that hyperref points to the correct page.
