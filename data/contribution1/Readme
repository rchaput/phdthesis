This folder contains the results from the experiments for the 1st contribution:
the Reinforcement Learning algorithms that learn ethical behaviours "in general",
with a focus on adaptation.

* `hyperparameters_` files contains scores about various hyperparameters for
each algorithm. They allow comparing the impact of each hyperparameter on the
algorithm's score, and determining the best hyperparameters for each algorithm.

* `scores.csv` contains the scores for each algorithm, evaluated with their
best hyperparameters, on all defined scenarii and reward functions.
They allow comparing the algorithms between them.

* `agents_details.pkl.xz` contains more detailed results than `scores.csv`.
Whereas scores are a single value for each run, the details here include the
agents' individual rewards at each step, for each agent, in every run.
They allow a better visualization of the agents' behaviours.
Its format is a compressed (XZ) Pickle (binary) file, to limit the file size
(the equivalent CSV would be +900M).
