We use the "fenced divs" to place the bibliography here, rather than at the end of the document.

<!--
The following lines change the appearance of the bibliography. It notably reduces
the text size so that more references appear on one page. It seems to also avoid
having a reference "cut off" by an end of page.
The lines were taken from the LaTeX template.
-->
\setstretch{1.1}
\renewcommand{\bibfont}{\normalfont\small}
\setlength{\biblabelsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\bibitemsep}{0.5\baselineskip plus 0.5\baselineskip}

# References {-}
<!--
This manually sets the header for this unnumbered chapter.
-->
\markboth{References}{References}
<!--
To remove the indentation of the first entry.
-->
\noindent

<!--
To create a hanging indent and spacing between entries. This line may need 
to be removed for styles that don't require the hanging indent.
-->

\setlength{\parindent}{-0.20in}

<!-- Fenced div that will be replaced with the bibliography by Pandoc -->
